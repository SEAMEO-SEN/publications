Innovation in pedagogical and education methods and techniques would significantly impact the lives and increase the success rate for children with disabilities to experience education contexts that are meaningful. Within this contention, the 3rd ICSE Conference would provide the opportunity, space and a spectrum of perspectives for educators and those involved in education especially in the field of Special Education to share, discuss and further developing actions that would enhance the lives of children with disabilities through innovations that transform the landscape of Special Education. New methods in teaching and learning, development of assistive devices, ICT applied teaching gadget and use of cyber learning give students with disabilities transformative perspectives of their own learning capacity and heightened awareness of their capabilities to be successful in their lives. Current development and research-based practices and models of innovation in teaching and learning as well as best practices will be disseminated in this conference.</p><div class="jss15"></div><span class="jss17" id="theme"></span><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 css-1anx036">Theme</h6><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-1tqv6h6">The 3rd ICSE 2019 theme is “Elevating Innovation for Sustainable Development of Special Needs Education” and is presented together with 17 subthemes</p><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><ul><li>Learning and Innovation for Students with Special Education Needs</li><li>Innovation in Early Intervention</li><li>Innovation in Inclusive Education</li><li>Transition from School to Employment</li><li>Innovation in Deafblind</li><li>Multiple Disabilities Education</li><li>Networking in Special Education</li><li>Policy on Disabilities</li><li>Gifted and Talented</li><li>Inclusive Education</li><li>Building and Sustaining Inclusive Society</li><li>Technical and Vocational Education Training (TVET) for Children with Special Educational Needs</li><li>Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) for Special Educational Needs</li><li>Teacher Training and Capacity Building</li><li>Cultural and Arts Appreciation for Children with Special Educational Needs</li><li>ICT and Assistive Technology for Children with Special Educational Needs</li><li>Empowering Families and Communities for Children with Special Educational Needs</li></ul></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss16 css-9l3uo3">Addressing access must be given priority and emphasis by addressing opportunities and barriers such as diverse learners needs, designing and implementing accommodative curriculum suited to the needs of children and responsive curriculum strategies in teaching and learning.

The research aims to improve children&#x27;s fine motor skills in daily activities. To achieve that goal the researcher implemented a motion development training program. This study is a Single Subject Research (SSR) with A-B-A design. Data collection uses tests and observations. The data obtained was analyzed using simple descriptive statistics displayed in tables and graphs. The results showed that there was an increase in fine motor abilities of the subjects after being given a bringing up training intervention. The subject&#x27;s ability increased from 45.8% at baseline 1 (A) to 70.8% at baseline 2 (A &#x27;).

So that religion tends to have no space in the discourse on inclusive education. The narrowness of the dialectical spaces regarding inclusive education could be because there are not many people who examine the relationship and contribution of religion to the concept of inclusive education. Even though there is no religion in its teachings to exclude the element of education from humans. Islam for example, has serious attention to education and human development. Islam also pays attention to equality of rights possessed by mankind especially in the aspect of education. Even the context of &#x27; Education for all&#x27;has been carried out by Islam at the beginning of its development in the city of Makkah. The lack of a study of inclusive education in Islam, encourages some researchers to associate Islam with inclusive education. Unfortunately the study only portrays the intersection of Islamic teachings with the principle of inclusive education. Even though in the context of inclusive education itself, Islam does not only have contact but Islam is the spirit of inclusive education, that all human beings have the same educational rights. Through literature studies, this paper aims to portray the paradigm of Inclusion education in Islam so that it can be found that Islam is present as the spirit of the inclusive education.</p></div></div><div class="MuiCardActions-root MuiCardActions-spacing css-3zukih"><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge css-1ex63bw" tabindex="0" href="/pdf/icse/2019/A10.02.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a></div></div><div class="jss15"></div></div><div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation MuiPaper-rounded MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiCard-root css-s18byi"><div class="MuiCardContent-root css-1qw96cp"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">Implementation of Indonesian Language Knowledge Assessment in Inclusion Classes</div></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-15qsggp">Meilia Ariviantty &amp; Yuyus Suherman</p></div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss18 css-9l3uo3">Abstract:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss19 css-9l3uo3">Assessment in the education process is a component that cannot be separated from other components, especially learning.

A full comprehension and application of selected words or phrases are a challenge for hearing impaired students whose exposure of the language in question is rather restricted. Observations were carried out on two groups of hearing impaired students. Both groups have been exposed to the targeted selected words and phrases. In fact, the groups have also been guided to develop two of the language skills with the application of the targeted selected words and phrases. The hearing impaired students have been drilled to write and read the targeted selected words and phrases. With the comprehension and application of the targeted selected words and phrases laid down to the students, a specially designed language board game is used to test the students’ language skills.
