              The 2nd International Conference on Special Education is the
              second to be held in the SEA region after the 1st ICSE 2015 that
              was jointly organized with the Ministry of Education Thailand. The
              International Conference on Special Education is one of the main
              agenda that SEAMEO SEN is committed to organize biennially. The
              success of the 1st ICSE 2015 has impacted significantly on the
              role of SEAMEO SEN as the regional center for training and
              research in Special Education. The main focus of the conference
              would be on developing special competencies of educators of SEN
              children with disabilities that are trending and concurrent with
              the Global Education Agenda. The conference not only would develop
              the knowledge and skills of the participants, presenters and
              speakers as it is an opportunity for understanding and developing
              the methods, the philosophical tenets that are the hall mark of
              professionalism in Special Education. The main outcome will be on
              the capacity of participants and those involved with Special
              Education to deliver optimal education of children with
              disabilities in all aspects; policy, administration, teacher
              training, financial strength and support, implementation and
              quality educational delivery and instruction as well communities
              and support from government and non-government bodies.

              Dear presenters of ICSE 2017
              <br />
              Greetings from SEAMEO SEN
              <br />
              Alhamdullilah we are able to organize the 2nd International
              Conference on Special Education 2017 and published this
              proceeding. The ICSE 2017 proceeding is the second proceeding to
              be published after the ICSE 2015 proceeding that was jointly
              published with the Ministry of Education Thailand. The ICSE 2017
              is a continuation of the 2nd International Conference on Special
              Education that is held this year in Borneo Convention Center in
              Kuching Sarawak, Malaysia. The papers in this proceeding are
              evidence of research based practices that will contribute to the
              building of knowledge and expertise of Special Education teachers
              in this region and beyond. SEAMEO SEN is committed to its vision
              and mission as a leading center of excellence in Special Education
              in this region. This conference is a definitive effort and hard
              work by SEAMEO SEN to present opportunities and platforms for
              convergence of discussion and current ideas in Special Education
              to all its attendees. The papers published in this proceeding are
              papers that are written and documented based on the sub themes of
              the conference which are mainly focused on inclusive education,
              innovations in Special Education and also on best practices in all
              areas of Special Education. On behalf of the reviewing committee
              team ICSE 2017, I would like to extend my appreciative note to the
              presenters who have contributed to the papers in this proceeding.
              The papers explicated and documented are very valuable to all
              Special Education educators in this region and for all educators
              worldwide. With the publication of this proceeding the papers
              published will be used as reference and source of information for
              educators. I am also extending my utmost appreciation to the
              experts of the reviewing team, the technical writers and the whole
              team from SEAMEO SEN for the publication of this proceeding. Much
              effort, time and technical work have been invested to ensure the
              proceeding will be published with standard and quality. I am sure
              our effort will be appreciated by the end users of this
              proceeding. I wish all the presenters and writers the best of luck
              in their future undertakings. Working within the Special Education
              field in the 21st century is indeed very challenging. The papers
              documented in this proceeding is the evidence of passion and love
              that we have for the betterment of our children with Special
              Education Needs. May all of us continue to work harder and become
              more resilient in our endeavor to champion the cause for our
              Special Children in this region. Together, we strive for
              excellence. Datin Dr. Hjh. Yasmin Hussain Director SEAMEO Regional
              Center For Special Education ( SEAMEO SEN )
