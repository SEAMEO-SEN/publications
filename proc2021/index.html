According to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), students with special educational needs have the right to receive necessary curricular adaptations. Every child has the ability to learn, but the way children learn and how much knowledge they can absorb can vary considerably, especially for a child with special educational needs. Yet, as a society we owe all children a chance to reach their potential, so it is important to create the best possible learning environment for that to happen. That’s why many people suggest mainstreaming special-needs children into regular classrooms rather than assigning them exclusively to special education classes. When all children, regardless of their differences, are educated together, everyone benefits, this is the cornerstone of inclusive education. Inclusive education has been discussed for more than twenty years. Both scholars and media brought up the inclusive education issue to bring awareness of it to society, and that momentum helps parents of SEN students to speak up for their offspring‘s rights. With the support from the law, legislation and society, drives or assists SEN students to equally access educational services, in the same way as students without disabilities. Within this contention, the 4th ICSE Conference would provide the opportunity, space and a spectrum of perspectives for educators and those involved in education especially in the field of Special Education to share, discuss and further developing actions that would enhance the lives of children with disabilities. Current development and research based practices and models in teaching and learning as well as best practices will be disseminated in this conference.</p><div class="jss9"></div><span class="jss11" id="theme"></span><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 css-1anx036">Theme</h6><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-1tqv6h6">The themes for 4th ICSE 2021 is “INCLUSION: A NEW CURVE” and supported by 16 sub-themes</p><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><ul><li>Technical and Vocational Education Training (TVET) for Students and Youths with Special Educational Needs</li><li>Learning and Innovation for Students with Special Educational Needs</li><li>Early Intervention</li><li>Inclusive Education</li><li>Health, Social Emotional Enhancement and Development for Special Needs</li><li>Transition from School to Employment</li><li>Multiple Disabilities Education</li><li>Networking in Special Education</li><li>Policy on Disabilities</li><li>Building and Sustaining Inclusive Society</li><li>Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) for Special Educational Needs</li><li>Teacher Training and Capacity Building</li><li>Disability-inclusive Disaster Risk Reduction (DiDRR)</li><li>Cultural and Arts Appreciation for Children with Special Educational Needs </li><li>Artificial Intelligence for Children with Special Educational Needs</li><li>Empowering Families and Communities for Children with Special Educational Needs</li></ul></div><div class="jss9"></div><span class="jss11" id="cofObjective"></span><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 css-1anx036">Conference objectives</h6><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss10 css-9l3uo3"><ul><li>Enhance the knowledge and skills of participants to deliver effective educational services and support services for children with special educational needs by updating and enriching knowledge and skills of those who take part in the educational process.</li><li>Provide the platform and opportunities for exchange of best practices in teaching and learning of children with special educational needs.</li><li>Provide information in recent trends in Special Education through exchange of best practices and current approaches that are tangible and responsive to the 21st century challenges and needs.</li><li>Establish networking and smart collaboration among Ministries, related agencies and educators in education especially in Special Education at national, regional and international levels.</li><li>Increase awareness and acceptance of individual with disabilities in the society and accommodating their needs in the community in terms of access, engagement and equity.</li></ul></div><span class="jss11" id="tarParticipant"></span><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 css-1anx036">Target Participants</h6><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss10 css-9l3uo3">The 4th ICSE 2021 is expected to be attended by 1,500 participants and delegates from Southeast Asia Countries and all around the world comprises of prominent speakers, teachers, educators, stakeholders, NGOs, parents, students, researchers, special education providers, policy makers, officials of MOE and interested individuals</p><div class="jss9"></div><span class="jss11" id="msgDirector"></span><h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 css-1anx036">Message from The Director of SEAMEO SEN</h6><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss10 css-9l3uo3">Dear delegates of the 4th International Conference for Special Education (ICSE) 2021.<br/>Warm greetings from SEAMEO SEN.<br/>It is my great pleasure to welcome you to the 4th ICSE 2021, which takes place virtually this time.

Each stakeholder involved has their responsibilities to create successful inclusive practice. However, many obstacles emerge in implementing inclusive education due to teachers&#x27; belief that they cannot teach special needs children, which is defined as teacher efficacy in inclusive practice. This study investigated the factor associated with teacher efficacy in inclusive practice, specifically in Indonesia&#x27;s inclusive primary school. Through quantitative analysis, this research aims to find out the relationship between perceived school support and demographic factors, such as gender, age, type of school, teaching experience, level of education, and training experience towards teacher efficacy. The measurement used in this study were PSSIE (Perceived School Support for Inclusive Education) (Ahmmed, 2013) and TEIP (Teacher Efficacy for Inclusive Practice) (Sharma et al., 2012). Using the convenience sampling technique, 324 inclusive primary school teachers from 15 provinces in Indonesia participated in this study. The result shows that perceived school support have a significant and positive relationship with teacher efficacy in inclusive practice (F(1, 322) = 129.978, p &lt; .001, R2 = .54). In terms of demographic factors, teacher efficacy is associated with age, type of school, level of education, and training experience. It can be concluded that teachers will have efficacy in teaching inclusive classrooms if they receive adequate support from the school, both physically and emotionally. In addition, middle-aged teachers, who work in inclusive private schools, have a high educational qualification, and have received training tend to have more efficacy in inclusive teaching.</p></div></div><style data-emotion="css 3zukih">.css-3zukih{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;padding:8px;}.css-3zukih>:not(:first-of-type){margin-left:8px;}</style><div class="MuiCardActions-root MuiCardActions-spacing css-3zukih"><style data-emotion="css 50yvxz">.css-50yvxz{font-family:"Roboto","Helvetica","Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:500;font-size:0.9375rem;line-height:1.75;letter-spacing:0.02857em;text-transform:uppercase;min-width:64px;padding:7px 21px;border-radius:4px;-webkit-transition:background-color 250ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) 0ms,box-shadow 250ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) 0ms,border-color 250ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) 0ms,color 250ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) 0ms;transition:background-color 250ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) 0ms,box-shadow 250ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) 0ms,border-color 250ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) 0ms,color 250ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) 0ms;border:1px solid rgba(25, 118, 210, 0.5);color:#1976d2;}.css-50yvxz:hover{-webkit-text-decoration:none;text-decoration:none;background-color:rgba(25, 118, 210, 0.04);border:1px solid #1976d2;}@media (hover: none){.css-50yvxz:hover{background-color:transparent;}}.css-50yvxz.Mui-disabled{color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.26);border:1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);}</style><style data-emotion="css 1ex63bw">.css-1ex63bw{display:-webkit-inline-box;display:-webkit-inline-flex;display:-ms-inline-flexbox;display:inline-flex;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;justify-content:center;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;-webkit-tap-highlight-color:transparent;background-color:transparent;outline:0;border:0;margin:0;border-radius:0;padding:0;cursor:pointer;-webkit-user-select:none;-moz-user-select:none;-ms-user-select:none;user-select:none;vertical-align:middle;-moz-appearance:none;-webkit-appearance:none;-webkit-text-decoration:none;text-decoration:none;color:inherit;font-family:"Roboto","Helvetica","Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:500;font-size:0.9375rem;line-height:1.75;letter-spacing:0.02857em;text-transform:uppercase;min-width:64px;padding:7px 21px;border-radius:4px;-webkit-transition:background-color 250ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) 0ms,box-shadow 250ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) 0ms,border-color 250ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) 0ms,color 250ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) 0ms;transition:background-color 250ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) 0ms,box-shadow 250ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) 0ms,border-color 250ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) 0ms,color 250ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) 0ms;border:1px solid rgba(25, 118, 210, 0.5);color:#1976d2;}.css-1ex63bw::-moz-focus-inner{border-style:none;}.css-1ex63bw.Mui-disabled{pointer-events:none;cursor:default;}@media print{.css-1ex63bw{-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;color-adjust:exact;}}.css-1ex63bw:hover{-webkit-text-decoration:none;text-decoration:none;background-color:rgba(25, 118, 210, 0.04);border:1px solid #1976d2;}@media (hover: none){.css-1ex63bw:hover{background-color:transparent;}}.css-1ex63bw.Mui-disabled{color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.26);border:1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);}</style><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge css-1ex63bw" tabindex="0" href="/pdf/icse/2021/007.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a></div></div><div class="jss9"></div></div><div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation MuiPaper-rounded MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiCard-root css-s18byi"><div class="MuiCardContent-root css-1qw96cp"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">Lived Experiences Of Senior High School Teachers In Handling Mainstream Classes: Teacher Development Plan</div></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-15qsggp">Vonn Clyde Casquejo Nuñez</p></div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss12 css-9l3uo3">Abstract:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss13 css-9l3uo3">This research determined the lived experiences of Senior High School Teachers handling Mainstream Classes at Babag National High School- Senior High School during the school year 2019-2020 as bases for a proposed teacher development plan. Babag National High School Senior High School Department implemented mainstream classes since the start of the K12 curriculum where teachers have less to no background in handling learners with special educational needs. The implementation of the class is in response to the Department’s “Education for All” and observation of inclusions. The respondents were eight (8) Senior High School teachers handling mainstream classes. The study investigated the experiences of the teachers in their classes in terms of lesson planning, delivery of instruction, assessment of learning, and monitoring and coaching. Also, further investigated on challenges, difficulties and best practices of these teachers in handling their mainstream classes. The research employed quantitative-qualitative design where data were treated using Mean Deviation and Thematic Content Analysis. The findings show that teachers provided less independent and guided practice, they modify lessons, but they have difficulties in associating these tasks to their condition, they should explain content of test material first before students perform task, and they have no time for parent’s conference for students’ progress. Their challenges deal on teaching pedagogies and lack of time. Most respondents’ best practices consist of task listing and personalized approach. Thus, teachers have varied lived experiences in handling mainstream class which are challenging for them. It is recommended to implement the proposed teacher development plan addressing areas of concerns in handling mainstream class.</p></div></div><div class="MuiCardActions-root MuiCardActions-spacing css-3zukih"><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge css-1ex63bw" tabindex="0" href="/pdf/icse/2021/011.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a></div></div><div class="jss9"></div></div><div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation MuiPaper-rounded MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiCard-root css-s18byi"><div class="MuiCardContent-root css-1qw96cp"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">The Suburbia Strategy: Positive Reinforcement To Improve The Learning Focus Of Special Needs Students (MBK)</div></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-15qsggp">Soufi Husairy bin Ahmad Hussain &amp; Shahrill bin Ramli</p></div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss12 css-9l3uo3">Abstract:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss13 css-9l3uo3">This Positive Reinforcement was implemented in a suburban school in Hulu Selangor to help improve the learning focus of Special Needs Students (MBK). The use of traffic light cards and token economy are aimed to elevate their speaking skills and self-confidence during the lessons in the classes. Prior to the programme, pupils lacked self-confidence and were not open to confide their problems in the lessons with the teachers. Moreover, pupils inclined to ask questions irrelevant to the topics concerned. This implied that pupils were unable to have full grasp on the lessons and thus to create possible problems for them to incorporate the knowledge taught in the classes into their lives. Through quantitative findings based on the pupils’ classwork and qualitative measurement based on non-partisan observation, it is found that Positive Reinforcement was considered successful as intervention strategy. Pupils are also seemed to be less-dependent on their peers and plagiarism amongst them was positively reduced. In order to enrich the knowledge of best practices in school, it is suggested that the whole unit of schools comprise of MBK and mainstream pupils to incorporate acculturation of traffic light cards so that conducive environment is to be conceived for teaching and facilitation sessions.</p></div></div><div class="MuiCardActions-root MuiCardActions-spacing css-3zukih"><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge css-1ex63bw" tabindex="0" href="/pdf/icse/2021/025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a></div></div><div class="jss9"></div></div><div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation MuiPaper-rounded MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiCard-root css-s18byi"><div class="MuiCardContent-root css-1qw96cp"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">Learning Vocabulary With “Buncee Add Smart” Among Students In Remediation Program</div></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-15qsggp">Hoe Sin Ling &amp; Yeo Kee Jiar</p></div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss12 css-9l3uo3">Abstract:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss13 css-9l3uo3">Buncee is a creation and presentation tool for students and educators to create interactive classroom content, allowing learners of all ages to visualize concepts and communicate creatively.

An effective teacher in an inclusive classroom is a teacher with high self-efficacy in handling students who have behavioral issues in their classroom. The pre-service teacher training of the Institute of Teacher Education Malaysia (IPGM) emphasizes on behavior management through several courses offered and enrichment activities outside of the lecture rooms. In this regard, several courses such as EDUP3023 Child Development, EDUP3043 Classroom Management and Behavior and also RBTS3132 Inclusive Education have been offered to expose trainee teachers to the knowledge in handling students with special needs for IPGM students who are not majors in special education. This concept paper on a descriptive quantitative study to be conducted to see the level of knowledge of trainee teachers, especially RBT major in one of the Institute of Teacher Education, Technical Education Campus (IPGKPT) on handling special needs students in inclusive education in schools. The methodology that will be use in this study involve questionnaires of a total 63 respondents of IPGKPT Semester 6 students who have studied the all three courses. The knowledge of RBT trainee teachers in handling MBK is anticipated to be in a high range as these three subjects involve many hands-on activities that require more control from the teachers during teaching and learning sessions.</p></div></div><div class="MuiCardActions-root MuiCardActions-spacing css-3zukih"><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge css-1ex63bw" tabindex="0" href="/pdf/icse/2021/053.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a></div></div><div class="jss9"></div></div></div><div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">Multiple Disabilities Education</div></div><div class="jss9"></div><div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation MuiPaper-rounded MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiCard-root css-s18byi"><div class="MuiCardContent-root css-1qw96cp"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">How Parents Of Children With Visual Impairment And Multiple Disabilities Support Each Other During This Time Of The Pandemic In The Philippines</div></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-15qsggp">Ami Tango-Limketkai</p></div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss12 css-9l3uo3">Abstract:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss13 css-9l3uo3">The global response to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has changed daily life in many ways for many people. In the Philippines, schools remain closed and stay-at-home orders went into effect nationwide. The struggles faced by parents of children with visual impairment with or without multiple disabilities have amplified. Supporting the bond between parents or caregivers of these children is as important as ever. This discussion aims to answer the question about how parents of children with visual impairment with or without multiple disabilities from different parts of the Philippines, support each other as they learn to adapt and meet their children&#x27;s needs as well as maintain their own mental health and relationships. We discussed the methods on how this support group, managed and run by parents themselves, build parent advocacy skills and self-efficacy skills as they cope during these times of the pandemic. We shared what activities were carried out despite the challenges this lockdown has brought and how these activities still allow families to regularly engage with each other and become present supporters of their children’s development as they help them thrive and learn during this pandemic. We discussed the value of support groups and identify recommendations for support group design based on the experiences and feedback of the parents from the Philippines. Qualitative methods was used to examine the experiences of members of 1 parent-run support group. 30 parents were interviewed about the benefits and limitations of participation in support group. Information was collected by observing support group meetings, activities, and reviewing group documents. Interview, observation, and document data was analyzed to identify emerging themes. Results of the study indicated that the effects of belonging to a parent-led parent support group were substantial. Through these groups, parents gain increased skills, an increased sense of power and a sense of belonging. Participants are able to connect with each other and provide support and skills to deal with the day-to-day issues of raising a child with disabilities.</p></div></div><div class="MuiCardActions-root MuiCardActions-spacing css-3zukih"><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge css-1ex63bw" tabindex="0" href="/pdf/icse/2021/034.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a></div></div><div class="jss9"></div></div></div><div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">Building and Sustaining Inclusive Society</div></div><div class="jss9"></div><div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation MuiPaper-rounded MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiCard-root css-s18byi"><div class="MuiCardContent-root css-1qw96cp"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">Addressing The Needs For Teachers’ Professional Development Amidst The Covid-19 Pandemic</div></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-15qsggp">Mohd Zulkarnain Abdul Wahab &amp; Hanani Harun Rasit</p></div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss12 css-9l3uo3">Abstract:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss13 css-9l3uo3">Learners with disabilities are among the most impacted group of children if not the most vulnerable compared to their peers of the same age. They are exposed to the risk of being left behind in society, employment as well as their participation in education.  Shortages of trained teachers and school personnel in implementing the concept of Inclusive Education in many countries have led to the increase challenges and delay especially in preparing learners with disabilities to be accepted and participate in the real world. Envisioning and responding towards achieving United Nation Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) specifically SDG No.4 “Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all”, SEAMEO 7 Priority Areas No. 2 “Addressing Barriers to Inclusion” and the previous statements and declaration regarding Inclusive Education, SEAMEO SEN has always aligned its roles to be at the forefront of Disability-Inclusive education advocacies, teachers’ competencies development, quality content creations and community awareness. Responding to these commitments, targeted researches were carried out to understand, learn and provide recommendations addressing to the needs of learners with disabilities. Training needs analysis and impactful training courses, workshops, seminars and conferences were also held in directing and harnessing teachers’ potential. This paper explicates SEAMEO SEN responses in promoting and enhancing the quality of special educational needs practices among its member countries including its responses during the COVID-19 pandemic situation. This paper further explores the programmes and activities conducted by SEAMEO SEN and how the centre adapts to respond to the current challenges.</p></div></div><div class="MuiCardActions-root MuiCardActions-spacing css-3zukih"><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge css-1ex63bw" tabindex="0" href="/pdf/icse/2021/012.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a></div></div><div class="jss9"></div></div><div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation MuiPaper-rounded MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiCard-root css-s18byi"><div class="MuiCardContent-root css-1qw96cp"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">Inclusive Education In Malaysia’s Primary Schools: The Teachers View</div></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-15qsggp">Rosmalily binti Salleh &amp; John Woollard</p></div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss12 css-9l3uo3">Abstract:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss13 css-9l3uo3">Malaysia, like many countries in the world, is recognising inclusive education and has pledged a commitment in the 2013-2025 Malaysia Education Blueprint. However, the journey of providing a quality and inclusive education for all is complex, leading to inconsistency in practice. The Malaysia context with its diverse ethnicity, language, culture, religion besides the education and school systems have implications for the promotion and implementation of inclusive education. This study explores and highlights teachers’ relevant yet overlooked perspectives on inclusion and inclusive education in the period of educational system reformation. By focusing on teachers’ perspectives, the research aims to provide a better understanding of the promotion of inclusive education in Malaysia’s primary schools. This interpretative, exploratory, qualitative study employed multiple methods to obtain rich and in-depth data. Participants are purposely sampled from five national primary schools: three schools with the Special Education Integration Programme (SEIP) and two schools without SEIP. They were 76 participants; 25 teachers were interviewed individually and 51 participated in eight focus-group interviews. Ten classroom observations were conducted prior to the individual interviews. The data were analysed thematically by the inductive approach, using NVivo software. Theories of inclusive education were adopted to analyse teachers’ responses. The results show that teachers view inclusive education as a challenging concept to implement. Such views are influenced by multiple factors, such as miscommunication between departments, sociocultural attitudes to disability, educational systems, inefficient utilisation of resources, insufficient facilities, and teachers’ lack of knowledge and skills about special education and pupils with special educational needs (SEN). The findings will be of value to those responsible for planning and developing the policy and programmes regarding inclusive education, special education, and specifically educational systems in moving towards inclusive systems and schools.</p></div></div><div class="MuiCardActions-root MuiCardActions-spacing css-3zukih"><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge css-1ex63bw" tabindex="0" href="/pdf/icse/2021/060.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a></div></div><div class="jss9"></div></div></div><div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">Cultural and Arts Appreciation for Children with Special Educational Needs</div></div><div class="jss9"></div><div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation MuiPaper-rounded MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiCard-root css-s18byi"><div class="MuiCardContent-root css-1qw96cp"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">Going Beyond The Personal: Perceptions Of Parents Of Individuals With Autism About Expressive Arts Therapy</div></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-15qsggp">Dominic T.

The study aimed to obtain the parent’s or the caregiver’s perceptions as to how the expressive arts have affected the person with autism and how it has also affected the dynamics of the family. The study found that other than creating motivation and a greater selfesteem in the student, it has also improved communication within the family. Expressive arts had created an avenue for understanding the family member with disability and create more empathy towards them. It has also brought about a sense of hopefulness in the family members regarding the future of these individuals. Thus, expressive arts had bridged the gap that the disability had created and has an integrative function for the individual, his/her family and the society.</p></div></div><div class="MuiCardActions-root MuiCardActions-spacing css-3zukih"><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge css-1ex63bw" tabindex="0" href="/pdf/icse/2021/059.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a></div></div><div class="jss9"></div></div><div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation MuiPaper-rounded MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiCard-root css-s18byi"><div class="MuiCardContent-root css-1qw96cp"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">The Innovation Of Music Notation Into Colour Coding And Numbers</div></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-15qsggp">Norihan Md Ishak, Norlela Jamhuri, Ruzaini Nayan &amp; Badrul Amin Ghazali</p></div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss12 css-9l3uo3">Abstract:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss13 css-9l3uo3">This study aims to see the extent to which the effectiveness of the use of musical notation that uses Colour Codes and Numbers to replace standard musical notation among Special Education students with Learning Disabilities.

It is deemed important that everyone adheres to the Philippine government mandates in its Republic Act 10121- Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has confirmed the close link between health and disaster risk reduction (UNDRR, 2021).  With the aim to achieve the substantial reduction of disaster risk and losses in lives, our school designed an Index on Disaster Preparedness that geared toward empowering the 4 Pillars of Disaster Risk Reduction with better understanding among our most vulnerable learners and their families. This descriptive research features the Index designed on Disaster Preparedness among Special Education learners of General Maximino Hizon Elementary School in the time of Covid-19 is a program initiative inspired by the School Disaster Risk Reduction Management and was designed explicitly for the learners with disabilities and their families. Eighty-seven (87) learners with disabilities and their families attended a webinar that highlights and enhance the integration of disaster risk reduction on building resiliency, stewardship, and empathy towards a safe, adaptive, disaster-ready families and communities; manage health and related risks including for disease outbreaks, which is a key example of a multi-sectoral approach to disaster risk management.</p></div></div><div class="MuiCardActions-root MuiCardActions-spacing css-3zukih"><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge css-1ex63bw" tabindex="0" href="/pdf/icse/2021/067.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a></div></div><div class="jss9"></div></div></div><div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">Health, Social Emotional Enhancement and Development for Special Needs</div></div><div class="jss9"></div><div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation MuiPaper-rounded MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiCard-root css-s18byi"><div class="MuiCardContent-root css-1qw96cp"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">Dealing With Children With Disabilities During Covid 19 : Understanding Parental Perspectives</div></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-15qsggp">Sariya Shabnam &amp; Farha Hossain</p></div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss12 css-9l3uo3">Abstract:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss13 css-9l3uo3">Parents of children with disabilities often appear to experience considerable stress and weakened emotional-well being. It is likely that the anxiety and emotional state of the parents are further exaggerated due to disrupted schedules of their children with disabilities during COVID 19 pandemic because of long-term school closure. The study aims to understand parental perspectives of dealing with children with disabilities during COVID 19 pandemic with an emphasis on the parent-child bonding. Fifteen parents and caregivers of children with disabilities participated in this qualitative study through semi-structured telephonic interviews. They were asked questions about behavioural changes of their children as well as bonding between themselves during this pandemic. Interview data were transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis technique was performed through manual coding. The findings of this study reveal that, significant behavioural changes of children with disabilities including increased restlessness, anger, fear, stress, hyper-activity, unwillingness to participate in academic as well as daily living activities, lack of motivation and concentration, significant learning loss, increased tendency of self-harming have occurred during covid-19 outbreak. The parent-child bonding seems to be highly affected (e.g. decreased quality time span &amp; loss of parental patience during joint attention) by children’s behavioural changes occurred due to school closure. Overall, the study finds that the emotional wellbeing of parents of children with disabilities and their bonding with their children have been unfavourably impacted by COVID19 pandemic. The study recommends that access to therapeutic services to support children with special needs can minimize the adverse effect of this lockdown. In addition, provision of expert wellbeing support for parents is also recommended.</p></div></div><div class="MuiCardActions-root MuiCardActions-spacing css-3zukih"><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge css-1ex63bw" tabindex="0" href="/pdf/icse/2021/008.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a></div></div><div class="jss9"></div></div><div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation MuiPaper-rounded MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiCard-root css-s18byi"><div class="MuiCardContent-root css-1qw96cp"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">The Development Of Aquaexplorers Module For Special Education Teachers In Penang: A Pilot Study</div></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-15qsggp">Nur Amalina Samsudin &amp; Aznan Che Ahmad</p></div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss12 css-9l3uo3">Abstract:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss13 css-9l3uo3">Background Although an aquatic activities such as swimming and hydro therapy is a common activities in Special Education classes in Penang, there are no one specific module that can be used as a guidance for that activities which contributed to an activity without objectives and goals Aims This study aimed to discover the effect of Aquaexplorers Module implementation on the knowledge and self-confidence of Special Education Teachers in Penang.

Poor emotion regulation leads to behavioural problems, such as loneliness, arrogance, aggression, rage and self-harm behaviours, and subsequently, this might contribute to social isolation and less potential to build friendships. In this paper, narrative synthesis was used to explore the causal factors of emotional regulation issues experienced by students with special educational needs and the effects of social emotional problems on these students. The findings from the narrative synthesis indicated that factors leading to emotional regulation issues among students with special educational needs are neurological factors, growth and development factors, peer social rejection factors, parenting factors, and teacher-related factors, while the effects of emotional regulation problems include social problems, behaviour problems, emotion problems, performance employment problems, and cognitive problems. From the narrative synthesis, conceptual frameworks related to the causes and effects of emotional regulation problems amongst students with special educational needs were induced to offer the direction of further investigation on this minimally researched area.</p></div></div><div class="MuiCardActions-root MuiCardActions-spacing css-3zukih"><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge css-1ex63bw" tabindex="0" href="/pdf/icse/2021/030.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a></div></div><div class="jss9"></div></div><div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation MuiPaper-rounded MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiCard-root css-s18byi"><div class="MuiCardContent-root css-1qw96cp"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">“Star Track” Project: Attracting Special Needs Students To Engage In Sports Activities And Improving The Interpersonal Skills Through Sports Activities</div></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-15qsggp">Nurul Huda Binti Zulkifli</p></div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss12 css-9l3uo3">Abstract:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss13 css-9l3uo3">The “Star Track” Project action research is aimed to attract Special Needs Students (SNS) to be involved in sports activities and improved their interpersonal skills by engaging in sports activities actively. This study was carried out due to the fact several SNSs in SMK Kampong Soeharto, have little interest in participating in sports activities and there are SNS who are still weak in their interpersonal skills. The main objective of the study was to identify the main reason of SNS&#x27;s non -involvement in sports activities and why it is difficult for them to master the interpersonal skills.

Inclusive education should also have the end in mind. With that, the Special Education Transition Enrichment Program (SETEP) of TW Community Enablers was birthed to address the concerns of parents and other stakeholders involved in the holistic education of the individual with special needs of what happens to the child after formal schooling. This case study aims to present the development of the mentioned program, the process of admission of the child to his/her exit from the program, the challenges that the program continually faces, and some suggestions to improve its implementation. The program has five tracks, namely: Independent living, Post-secondary education, Community participation, Employment, and Leisure and Recreation. The program boasts an interdisciplinary approach that supports the individual’s total development as he/she is prepared for independent living. Although the program faced challenges, it shows its strength in its comprehensiveness and individualized approach to transition education. The program sees that more advocacy work should be done for transition programs like SETEP to flourish in the Philippines.</p></div></div><div class="MuiCardActions-root MuiCardActions-spacing css-3zukih"><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge css-1ex63bw" tabindex="0" href="/pdf/icse/2021/062.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a></div></div><div class="jss9"></div></div></div><div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">Technical and Vocational Education Training (TVET) for Students and Youths with Special Educational Needs</div></div><div class="jss9"></div><div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation MuiPaper-rounded MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiCard-root css-s18byi"><div class="MuiCardContent-root css-1qw96cp"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">Implementation Of The Internship Program For Student With Special Needs At The High School Level</div></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-15qsggp">Basyit Wulan Istikamah &amp; Edi Purwanta</p></div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss12 css-9l3uo3">Abstract:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss13 css-9l3uo3">This study aims to reveal how school readiness is in the process of adding insight to the world of work and adding skills or Internships for children with special needs at the high school level. This research uses a descriptive approach. The subjects of this study were principals and teachers from several special schools. Data collection was carried out through surveys. The results of this study are as follows: schools do not yet have vocational teachers who are linear with the areas they can provide, facilities for teaching vocational education to children with special needs at the secondary level are inadequate, lack of parental involvement to be involved in the preparation of vocational programs for students with special needs, several schools have not carried out an internship program for children with special needs at the senior high school level and there has not been any cooperation with the business world and the industrial world due to the difficulty of the business world and the industrial world in accepting children with special needs for the internship program.

The interventions that were utilized called PEP (Puzzles, Edmodo and Punnet Blocks) were combination of teaching and learning activities which enabled the students improved learning of students on the said concepts. Puzzles using the improvised punnet blocks will help them to easily understand the concept in Genetics specifically on Monohybrid and Dihybrid crosses. These interventions were aligned with the New Normal in the absence of the face to face learning. The intervention will be implemented through Online Distance Learning Modality where series of puzzles and activities were uploaded in Edmodo. The proponent used the descriptive-comparative approach using the paired sample t-test in determining the significant difference of their pre and post-test and the effectiveness of the PEPs intervention through Cohen’s d formula. The data gathered by the researcher conveyed that the students with learning gaps in Genetic Concepts particularly in Monohybrid and Dihybrid crosses had greatly learned a lot after the intervention, through an increased percentage of their mastery in Genetic Concepts. Hence, the intervention applied had been found to be truly effective. The Intervention helped the students increased their academic performance particularly on the mastery of monohybrid and dihybrid crosses thru the guidance of their parents and siblings. These interventions with the use of the platform Edmodo, motivated them to learn more in the absence of Face to face learning because of the Pandemic. It was then recommended that coming up with other interventions will be a great help to the improvement of the academic performance not only for the coping students but for all the students in the class.</p></div></div><div class="MuiCardActions-root MuiCardActions-spacing css-3zukih"><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge css-1ex63bw" tabindex="0" href="/pdf/icse/2021/013.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a></div></div><div class="jss9"></div></div><div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation MuiPaper-rounded MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiCard-root css-s18byi"><div class="MuiCardContent-root css-1qw96cp"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">The Doormat Project To Improve Basic Sewing Skills Of Special Needs Students With Low Functioning</div></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-15qsggp">Sarogeni Krishnasamy &amp; Habibah Binti Hamzah</p></div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss12 css-9l3uo3">Abstract:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss13 css-9l3uo3">Doormat’s study was to evaluate the effectiveness of project work conducted on low-functioning students in PPKI SMK Taman Bunga Raya (1).

The Special Needs Students Career Transition Program was implemented to prepare the Special Needs Students with basic and vocational skills as well as individual employment aspects. The objective of the study was to (1) identify the level of readiness among Special Education Teachers in the implementation of the Career Transition Program for Special Needs students in the Special Education Integrated Program (SEIP) and (2) identify the Special Need Student readiness level in the Career Transition Program at SEIP. The research methodology used quantitative method and survey to answer the research questions. The sample were 107 Special Education teachers who implemented the Career Transition Program in schools. The findings show that the readiness level of special education teachers (mean=3.99) need to be enhanced with the implementation of the basic skills courses and the Malaysian Skills Certificate (MSC). Special Needs Students (SNS) [mean=3.88] need to be trained and equipped with 3 basic skills (Reading, Writing, Counting), Vocational Basic skills, Basic self-management skills, Social skills, Communication skills, Problem solving skills, Basic technology skills and deep interest in the field before participating in the Career Transition Program. Meanwhile, the aspects of compliance with the Career Transition Program Guidelines are well-respected and need to be further enhanced among school administrators. It is proposed in the future, all the Special Education teachers must have the Malaysian Skills Certificate and Vocational Skills courses in order to enhance their competence. SNS should be educated with a high degree of self-determination based on their abilities and passion. Systematic Career Transition Program modules and frameworks need to be developed to explain SNS direction upon completion of the Career Transition Program. It is hoped that this study will provide ideas and contributions in streamlining and implementing the Career Transition Program in the future.</p></div></div><div class="MuiCardActions-root MuiCardActions-spacing css-3zukih"><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge css-1ex63bw" tabindex="0" href="/pdf/icse/2021/029.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a></div></div><div class="jss9"></div></div><div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation MuiPaper-rounded MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiCard-root css-s18byi"><div class="MuiCardContent-root css-1qw96cp"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">Urban Farming Cik Tebu Manis : Changes In Behaviour And Interests Of Students With Special Needs (MBK)</div></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-15qsggp">Normazian Binti Mohamad Nordin, Mahezan Binti Mat Jusoh &amp; Magdelane Anak Stephen Ayot</p></div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss12 css-9l3uo3">Abstract:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss13 css-9l3uo3">The Best DuA Integration Special Education Program became first in the Hulu Selangor District to carry out the “Urban Farming” fertigation project which was carried out in early 2018 until now. Urban Farming Cik Tebu targets medium and low functional students in the teaching and learning process in schools. Therefore, this study was conducted to find out the extent to which the influence of specific vocational skills subjects and basic crop skills can build students&#x27; interest in the field of agriculture and in turn make the agricultural sector as a career opportunity. Preliminary observations found that students were not focused during the teacher&#x27;s teaching process, were too active to be disciplined and unskilled in using their psychomotor skills. The study of the Urban Farming project, which was conducted over a period of 6 months, focused on the preparation work of the Urban Farming project by planting various types of vegetables such as solok chillies, rice chillies, large chillies, cabbage and bitter gourd in locations close to special education classes.

This research included a total of 2 students in special need as participants. The first step in action planning was to recognize students who struggle in memorizing and reciting memorized common surahs with minimal errors in pronunciation. This research also aims to ensure that students are not bored during the learning process and to encourage students to memorize the Quran’s surah. This research was carried out using diverse teaching methods and resources by using Interactive Flash Card, a digital process that replaces the previous handmade cards (traditionally). Sentences are typed on a computer with using MS Word and the card‘s background are made colourful. Each card includes sentences that have been cut short based on the student’s skill. The respondents were given a pre-test and post-test. The result of the study (post test) showed that 2 students were able to memorize the traditional surahs more effectively after the intervention. As a result using I-Flash Card in the classroom is successful in enhancing students’ memorizing and reciting with minimal errors in pronunciation once it is introduced.</p></div></div><div class="MuiCardActions-root MuiCardActions-spacing css-3zukih"><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge css-1ex63bw" tabindex="0" href="/pdf/icse/2021/021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a></div></div><div class="jss9"></div></div></div><div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) for Special Educational Needs</div></div><div class="jss9"></div><div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation MuiPaper-rounded MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiCard-root css-s18byi"><div class="MuiCardContent-root css-1qw96cp"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">A Systematic Review Of The Influence Of Teachers’ Knowledge On The Use Of Assistive Technology</div></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-15qsggp">Choo Bee Giek</p></div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss12 css-9l3uo3">Abstract:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss13 css-9l3uo3">Assistive technology is an essential tool that supports students in their learning participation and provide opportunities for their education, social interactions and social relationship. Teachers’ knowledge in assistive technology has consistently shown to be required for them to come out with proper modification and differentiation using assistive technology for students with l special educational needs in inclusive education. There are numerous studies aimed at reviewing the impact of teachers’ knowledge on the use of assistive technologies among elementary and secondary school teachers. This review intended to summarise the context of teachers’ knowledge in the domain of general inclusive education and explore the instrument used, sample selection, validity and reliability as reported in the related studies. Electronic database includes Education Source, ERIC (Educational Resource Index and Abstracts), EBSCOhost by Elton B. Stephens Company and Scopus were systematically searched, reviewing published studies from January 2011 to January 2021 with the inclusion criteria selecting any study which focused on teachers’ knowledge and their use of assistive technology with special educational need students in inclusive education. Of the 6 reviewed published studies, teachers’ knowledge reported to have a positive impact on their use of assistive technology and have an influence on their level of confidence in integrating assistive technology in teaching. Recommendations for future studies include preparedness of pre-service teachers for assistive technology use in inclusive education to ensure they have sufficient knowledge for the use of assistive technology in teaching.</p></div></div><div class="MuiCardActions-root MuiCardActions-spacing css-3zukih"><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge css-1ex63bw" tabindex="0" href="/pdf/icse/2021/001.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a></div></div><div class="jss9"></div></div><div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation MuiPaper-rounded MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiCard-root css-s18byi"><div class="MuiCardContent-root css-1qw96cp"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">The Level Of Problem-Solving Skills Of Gifted Students In Jordan, A Comparative Study Between The Schools Of Excellence And The Jubilee School</div></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-15qsggp">Aznan Che Ahmad, Mahmoud Ghazi Ewies &amp; Aswati Hamzah</p></div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss12 css-9l3uo3">Abstract:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss13 css-9l3uo3">Problem-solving skills are considered one of the essential skills of the twenty-first century because nations and individuals face various problems.

Purposive sampling was used to choose three male students diagnosed with AD/HD where in one with comorbid ASD, with ages ranging from 9-11 years old. Social communication skills of the participants were measured using Social Communication Score Scale where in scores were computed. Each participant was observed in two contexts such as virtual reality sessions and real-life setting. Field notes and a recording camera were used to capture the observations in both settings. Patterns of behaviors, activities and events were noted down. Specifically it sought to answer the two questions: What were the effects of VRRP on the social communication skills of children with AD/HD during intervention in VR and RL; and what were the effects of the VRRP on the SCS of children with AD/HD after the intervention in VR and RL. VRRP included teaching SCS through conversations with a virtual peer by role-play activities in a monitor-based 3-D environment. Human avatars represented students who were conversing in real-time. Social Communication Score Scale was used to measure the participants’ SCS by retrieving video recordings used in all observations in the VR context and RL settings of each participant. Field notes were used to note down themes that emerged in the study. Results showed that children improved in social communication skills but they varied in terms background specifically, behavior, comprehension skill and an uncontrolled variable was also identified; structure is needed to develop and demonstrate the social communication skills in the classroom; skill in ending a conversation in the RL was not common; the presence and prompts of the teacher beside each child during was needed; explicit instruction design in different stages was beneficial; the role-plays with combination of scaffolding and 3-D features of the software promoted interest and was helpful; and repetitions of activities could lead to boredom and would affect the child’s social communication skills. Recommendations included promoting and creating a structured environment to enhance SCS and creating a software for children and teachers.</p></div></div><div class="MuiCardActions-root MuiCardActions-spacing css-3zukih"><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge css-1ex63bw" tabindex="0" href="/pdf/icse/2021/005.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a></div></div><div class="jss9"></div></div></div><div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">Networking in Special Education</div></div><div class="jss9"></div><div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation MuiPaper-rounded MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiCard-root css-s18byi"><div class="MuiCardContent-root css-1qw96cp"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">Exploring The Lived Experiences Of Parents Having Learners With Special Educational Needs In The New Normal Education</div></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-15qsggp">Jake P.

Therefore, this study conducts a methodology based on a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to determine preschool teachers&#x27; knowledge on the early detection of dyslexia for students in preschool. This study showed an investigation from October to December 2020 in three academic search systems, namely Scopus, Google Scholar and Mycite. The search yielded 29 articles and has identified 6 articles in the screening and evaluation process. Search terms are knowledge, preschool teachers, early detection, dyslexia and preschool students. This study shows that preschool teachers&#x27; knowledge of the early detection of dyslexia for preschool students is still at an unsatisfactory level. Furthermore, this study is also still poorly implemented either locally or abroad. Worryingly, the study also found that there are still no early detection instruments of dyslexia for preschool students in Malaysia. No early detection causes many students to be late in obtaining interventions. The implications of this study indicate that there is a need to establish an instrument for the early detection of dyslexia for preschool students in Malaysia.</p></div></div><div class="MuiCardActions-root MuiCardActions-spacing css-3zukih"><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge css-1ex63bw" tabindex="0" href="/pdf/icse/2021/014.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a></div></div><div class="jss9"></div></div><div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation MuiPaper-rounded MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiCard-root css-s18byi"><div class="MuiCardContent-root css-1qw96cp"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">Transforming Teaching And Learning For Students With Complex Communication Needs Using Innovative Mobile Technology: Ups And Down</div></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-15qsggp">Kalaimathi Rajagopal &amp; Low Hui Min</p></div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss12 css-9l3uo3">Abstract:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss13 css-9l3uo3">Two-way interactions in classroom are remarkably challenging, especially when students with complex communication needs are concerned due to their inability to express their needs and wants verbally. One method that could establish effective two-way teacher-student interactions is through augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems. A qualitative study exploring special education teachers’ awareness and knowledge regarding high-tech AAC systems was conducted. The barriers and challenges that may hinder teachers from adopting mobile-based AAC systems, and the teachers’ expectations of the AAC applications were explored. The qualitative data obtained from semi-structured interviews revealed that (a) teachers are unaware that AAC systems could improve dyadic classroom interactions, (b) teachers face internal and external barriers in implementing high-tech AAC systems in their classrooms, and (c) teachers want AAC systems which are suitable to be used in classrooms. The findings provided insights for transforming classroom teaching and learning using innovative mobile technology for students with complex communication needs.</p></div></div><div class="MuiCardActions-root MuiCardActions-spacing css-3zukih"><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge css-1ex63bw" tabindex="0" href="/pdf/icse/2021/045.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a></div></div><div class="jss9"></div></div><div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation MuiPaper-rounded MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiCard-root css-s18byi"><div class="MuiCardContent-root css-1qw96cp"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">Learning Module Development: Lived Experiences Of Teachers In The Higher Education Institutions In The Philippines</div></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-15qsggp">Jake Boy D.

Still, a sudden shift happened when the COVID-19 came in. Moreover, the recent problem brought by the pandemic made the whole educational system of the world change. With the growing problem, tertiary education has to divert its face-to-face instruction to a more suitable situation. In pursuing a continuative learning process, schools then used resources available to develop learning modules due to unstable internet connectivity. Therefore, the teachers need to look at the teachers&#x27; experiences in learning modules to see what other interventions might be effective. This qualitative study examines the lived experiences of teachers in tertiary education institutions in the Philippines. The Colaizzi strategy by Shosa (2012) analyzed the participants&#x27; narrative responses. It brought the themes that speak of the positive and negative experiences in adapting the modules for instruction, injecting creativity in making learning modules, new teacher activities using modules, and doing student-centered modules. After working with the themes of the narrative given by the participants, the researcher then concluded that the need for teacher training for the success of teaching in higher education is needed given the reality that the Philippines has been numbered as one of the countries whose internet connectivity is weak. Adapting flexible learning modalities through modules is a tool in making learning effective and considerate for both teacher and learner in this current pandemic. Re-tooling and enhancing the capacity of teachers in higher education will greatly help so that the modular instruction as means for teaching be that effective.</p></div></div><div class="MuiCardActions-root MuiCardActions-spacing css-3zukih"><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge css-1ex63bw" tabindex="0" href="/pdf/icse/2021/047.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a></div></div><div class="jss9"></div></div><div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation MuiPaper-rounded MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiCard-root css-s18byi"><div class="MuiCardContent-root css-1qw96cp"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">Communication Level Of Trainee Teachers From Institut Pendidikan Guru Kampus Pendidikan Teknik With Autistic Children</div></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-15qsggp">Nur Qayyimah Mohd Zubaidi, Nik Farah ‘Aqilah Nik Mahadi, Hanani Harun Rasit &amp; Syamsiah Mokhtar</p></div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss12 css-9l3uo3">Abstract:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss13 css-9l3uo3">This concept paper describes a study which will be conducted to identify the level of communication among trainee teachers at the Institut Pendidikan Guru Kampus Pendidikan Teknik (IPGKPT) with autistic children.

This research aimed to find out the types of intervention in school-based interventions and implementation of school-based interventions for children with autism spectrum disorders. This research used a literature study with a qualitative approach consisting of three stages, data collection, data analysis, and conclusion/drawing. The literature was collected from various sources related to school-based interventions for children with autism spectrum disorders. Eleven out of twelve articles showed that school-based interventions with multiple types of intervention could provide positive benefits for developing social communication and behavior of children with autism spectrum disorders. The implementation of school-based interventions consists of 4 stages, namely: (1) identification and assessment, (2) program planning, (3) program implementation, (4) program evaluation. School-based interventions for children with autism spectrum disorders are strategic solutions to overcome children&#x27;s social-communication and behavior problems and obstacles without spending more.</p></div></div><div class="MuiCardActions-root MuiCardActions-spacing css-3zukih"><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge css-1ex63bw" tabindex="0" href="/pdf/icse/2021/016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a></div></div><div class="jss9"></div></div><div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation MuiPaper-rounded MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiCard-root css-s18byi"><div class="MuiCardContent-root css-1qw96cp"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">Challenges And Coping Strategies Of Special Education Teachers With Online And Modular Learning</div></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-15qsggp">Sally M.

This study utilized an online questionnaire which asked SpEd teachers from public and private schools regarding challenges and problems they encounter; coping strategies that they perform; and recommendations they may give to mitigate the problems being experienced. 43 SpEd teachers responded to the online questionnaire. The researcher also conducted a virtual focused group discussion (FGD) with 14 SpEd teachers, in attendance, to validate the responses. Among the mentioned roles of a SpEd teacher, more than half identified screening (intake of new students to the SpEd program) and choosing appropriate teaching strategies as challenging or they were able to do so after performing adjustments. Almost half of the respondents identified assessment (identifying students’ performance for the school year) and creating Individualized Educational Plans (IEPs) as very challenging or they were not able to do them anymore when they shifted to online learning. The most identified challenges encountered were: families lacking resources; slow/ intermittent internet connection; difficulty balancing time between teaching and family life; and students being more distracted at home. The most identified coping strategies were: seeking help from families for support, self-care tasks, time management, and praying. Most of the teachers identified having constant communication with their students’ families helped in the adjustment with online learning. On the recommendations, most of the teachers mentioned that there should be more teachers to be hired especially in the public school setting, implement adequate training to help teachers perform their roles accordingly, and provide clear guidelines that will be implemented by the school administration together with the teachers and families. The study then offered suggestions to help teachers cope with online and modular learning.</p></div></div><div class="MuiCardActions-root MuiCardActions-spacing css-3zukih"><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge css-1ex63bw" tabindex="0" href="/pdf/icse/2021/003.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a></div></div><div class="jss9"></div></div></div><div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">Learning and Innovation for Students with Special Educational Needs</div></div><div class="jss9"></div><div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation MuiPaper-rounded MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiCard-root css-s18byi"><div class="MuiCardContent-root css-1qw96cp"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">How To Improve Autistic Student’s Handwriting</div></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-15qsggp">Hui Ling Ch’ng &amp; Aznan Che Ahmad</p></div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss12 css-9l3uo3">Abstract:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss13 css-9l3uo3">Autism is a lifelong neurological disorder that affects the weaknesses of memory and causes visual-motor coordination skills impairment. This problem constrains autistic students from mastering handwriting skills. Their handwriting is illegible. This single-subject design research aims to identify the effect of “Efficient Writing” on autistic students’ handwriting in the following aspects: visual motor skills and letter formation proficiency to improve the autistic students’ handwriting. In this study, the ABA design was selected. The study was carried out in an intervention centre at Seberang Perai Tengah, Penang. In this study, just one sample was used. The independent variable of this research is “Efficient Writing&#x27; which underpins the combination of the Brain Gym and The Size Matter Handwriting Programme concept that underlies the Bandura social cognitive learning theory. Over six weeks, “Efficient Writing” was implemented for 80 minutes daily by an experienced special education teacher. A pre-test was given in the first phase (baseline phase) before the intervention was implemented. During the intervention phase, the informal assessment was carried out to identify the respondent’s progress. A post-test was given after the treatment ended. The data collected during the intervention phase was analyzed using visual inspection. The documentation analysis was done on the respondent’s pre and post-test paper to support the data collected during the intervention phase. The outcome of the research shows that there is a significant difference in the respondent’s handwriting. The independent variable in this research, “Efficient Writing” can improve autistic students’ handwriting.</p></div></div><div class="MuiCardActions-root MuiCardActions-spacing css-3zukih"><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge css-1ex63bw" tabindex="0" href="/pdf/icse/2021/009.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a></div></div><div class="jss9"></div></div><div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation MuiPaper-rounded MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiCard-root css-s18byi"><div class="MuiCardContent-root css-1qw96cp"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">Problem Of Sentence Structure Of Children With Hearing Impairment In Elementary School</div></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-15qsggp">Munawir Yusuf, Feri Adriyanto, Priyono, Winda Greatta Zakiah &amp; Soedjono</p></div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss12 css-9l3uo3">Abstract:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss13 css-9l3uo3">This study aims to find out the problem of sentence structure of deaf children in elementary school.

According to the educational standards students with disabilities should be provided with opportunities to realize their potential. However, millions of children in poor or developing countries lack access to schools and support services. The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified this struggle. Over the last decade, technology has advanced to a great extent. Technology can be a powerful tool for assisting children with special needs and can serve as a great equalizer. Persuasive Technologies can help overcome challenges in learning and developing by revolutionizing the way education is delivered. Web 2.0 has the ability to change the way people communicate and interact.

The purpose of this study as a way to educate SEN learning problems that often disagree, often fight, make too much noise, extreme movement and disturb peers in the classroom. Based on observations, such disruptive behaviors result in students being less focused and disrupt teaching and learning sessions. Therefore, this activity is expected to provide awareness and gentleness to SEN of the learning problems involved. It can also strengthen the practice of performing obligatory prayers 5 times a day at home. In line with the Malaysian National Education Philosophy, this activity is an effort to provide students who are balanced and harmonious in terms of intellectual, spiritual, emotional and physical. Qualitative methods were used for data collection and analysis through observations, interviews and document analysis. Findings from this study, found that 4 out of 6 SEN people with learning difficulties showed an increase in positive behaviors. The conclusion from this study, there are some improvements that need to be implemented to improve the student&#x27;s potential as a continuation of the activity Indahnya Solat in order to bring better results and effects. Among them are the mentee mentor program, collaborative with Islamic Education subjects, Bestari Solat Camp and Implementation of Dhuha Prayer Activities.</p></div></div><div class="MuiCardActions-root MuiCardActions-spacing css-3zukih"><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge css-1ex63bw" tabindex="0" href="/pdf/icse/2021/028.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a></div></div><div class="jss9"></div></div><div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation MuiPaper-rounded MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiCard-root css-s18byi"><div class="MuiCardContent-root css-1qw96cp"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">Enhancing Students’ Interest In Teaching Mathematics By Using Quizizz Apllication During Movement Control Order (MCO)</div></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-15qsggp">Siti Faezah Binti Kadri &amp; Nur Fajrina Binti Hayroman</p></div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss12 css-9l3uo3">Abstract:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss13 css-9l3uo3">Nowadays, online game like Quizizz is one of the alternative methods in interactive teaching and learning.

The target group involves 5 SENP Year 4 pupils, SK Jalan Enam, Bandar Baru Bangi, Selangor. This SENP consists of an autistic pupil, a Down Syndrome pupil and three pupils with intellectual disabilities. Preliminary surveys were carried out through reviewing of pupil’s work and observations. Preliminary survey results showed that SENP did not submit the assignments that they were supposed to do. Researcher used Liveworksheet digital application to overcome this problem. The instruments used were through observation method, data collection and questionnaires. The results of the study showed that SENP have shown some improvement in submitting the assignments timely and consistently. The implication of this study is that educators can use the Liveworksheet digital application to attract pupils’ attention as well as to improve the submission of assignments among SENP. Hence, educators should use variety of other applications of game-based systems during home learning and continue to seek out these innovative approaches. SENP really enjoy the online digital application as determined from verbal feedback and their request in play Liveworksheet.</p></div></div><div class="MuiCardActions-root MuiCardActions-spacing css-3zukih"><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge css-1ex63bw" tabindex="0" href="/pdf/icse/2021/064.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a></div></div><div class="jss9"></div></div><div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation MuiPaper-rounded MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiCard-root css-s18byi"><div class="MuiCardContent-root css-1qw96cp"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">Predictive Distinctives Towards Engagement In Inclusive Education</div></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-15qsggp">Janine Joy L.

Undoubtedly, teachers play an indispensable role in the success of such educational mantra. This research assessed the competency of the regular public elementary school teachers handling inclusive classes; and the benefits of inclusive education during school year 2019 to 2020 in Cebu City to propose an appropriate and relevant development plan. There were 63 respondents who were identified using cluster sampling and were asked to answer the adapted survey questionnaire. The data gathered were organized and treated statistically using frequency count, percentage, weighted mean, Pearson r and multiple regressions. Findings showed that most of the respondents were females whose field of specialization were not aligned with special education and were not exposed to relevant trainings in inclusion. Moreover, the respondents perceived themselves to be highly competent in handling inclusive classes; and viewed inclusive education to be highly beneficial for the learners with and without special needs. There was a significant relationship between the teachers’ competence in handling inclusive classrooms and the benefits of education. Lastly, there was no significant relationship between the respondents’ profile and their perceived competence. Thus, it is highly recommended that the proposed teachers’ development plan of this study be adopted, implemented, and monitored to continuously enhance the teachers’ competence in implementing inclusion for the benefits of the students with or without special needs.</p></div></div><div class="MuiCardActions-root MuiCardActions-spacing css-3zukih"><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge css-1ex63bw" tabindex="0" href="/pdf/icse/2021/042.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a></div></div><div class="jss9"></div></div></div><div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">Early Intervention</div></div><div class="jss9"></div><div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation MuiPaper-rounded MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiCard-root css-s18byi"><div class="MuiCardContent-root css-1qw96cp"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">Attitudes Of Students Towards The Deaf And Hard Of Hearing Inclusive Secondary Education</div></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-15qsggp">Roy S.

The study was conducted at La Salle Green Hills Adult Night High School in School Year 2019-2020. The researcher of the study used the purposive sampling technique in choosing its DHH respondents and convenience sampling technique in choosing its hearing students and teacher respondents. This study made use of the descriptive method of research design in the hope of seeking and describing the current status of the variables involved in the study. On the basis of the findings in this study, the researcher concludes that (a) both hearing students and DHH students have a strong positive cognitive attitude towards inclusion, (2) both hearing students and DHH students have a strong positive affective attitude towards inclusion, (3) DHH students have a positive behavioral attitude towards inclusion while hearing students have a strong positive behavioral attitude, and (d) there is no significant difference between the overall attitudes of the respondents toward DHH inclusive secondary classroom. This implies that both respondents have common cognitive, affective, and behavioral actions in an inclusive secondary education. Awareness/orientation programs, faculty development sessions, more collaborative activities between hearing and DHH learners, sign language classes, training for interpreters in the subjects they are assigned to, and involvement of parents and guardians in the program are thought to be needed by the students and teachers of the school.</p></div></div><div class="MuiCardActions-root MuiCardActions-spacing css-3zukih"><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined MuiButton-outlinedPrimary MuiButton-sizeLarge MuiButton-outlinedSizeLarge css-1ex63bw" tabindex="0" href="/pdf/icse/2021/002.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a></div></div><div class="jss9"></div></div><div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation MuiPaper-rounded MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiCard-root css-s18byi"><div class="MuiCardContent-root css-1qw96cp"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><div class="MuiBox-root css-1vg6q84">The Evaluation Of “Efficient Writing” On Autistic Student In Intervention Center</div></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-15qsggp">Hui Ling Ch’ng &amp; Aznan Che Ahmad</p></div><div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss12 css-9l3uo3">Abstract:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 jss13 css-9l3uo3">Although most autistic students have difficulties in letter formation, studies on the development of autism writing skills are scarce.

Only one autistic student who has severe handwriting difficulties was selected as the sample of this study by implementing the ABA design. Data was collected through repeated measurement of respondent&#x27;s handwriting skill in terms of the neatness followed by documentation analysis and semi-structured interview. The result showed that respondent had made a significant improvement in handwriting. Respondent&#x27;s handwriting remained neat even after the intervention had been withdrawn.

The ECCD offers a safe and nurturing environment for all children while at the same time challenging them to develop independence and the tools of exploration. Perkins International developed an adapted version of the Person Centered Planning process at Hejo ECCD to help each family to share their child, and their dreams as well as their fears with the ECCD staff so the whole team could develop a map together for the year ahead. This powerful and positive process was first developed to support children with disabilities and delays and their families, but was quickly extended by the Director to cover all children in the center.
